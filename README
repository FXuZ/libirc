libirc
========
A Python module that allows you to connect to IRC in a simple way.
This module can work on both Python 2 and 3, however, you need to use Unicode
strings if you use Python 2.

This module has two layers: IRCConnection and IRCClient.
The former uses polling, and the latter, which can handle more things like name listing, uses callback.

For example, view EXAMPLE.
